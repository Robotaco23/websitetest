Project Report
        Our project is an interactive quiz that contains 10 multiple choice questions, which we have named Quiz Whiz. The questions that are present on the quiz are trivia questions from different categories. As you are taking the quiz you will have 4 different answers to choose from or true and false. Once you click your answer it will either be wrong and move to the next question or it will be correct and award you 10 points and then move onto the next question. Once you complete the quiz your score will be displayed and can be added to the high score page along with your name. You can then play again or return to the home screen. We also added a login and signup page that are only for demonstration purposes.
